# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-ML-Project

This is my official machine learning project where I have used machine learning algorithms like Random Forest, K-Nearest Neighbour, Support Vector Machine etc. to detect Credit Card Fraud. The dataset I have used was collected from https://www.kaggle.com/kartik2112/fraud-detection 
Initially there are 2 datasets, which I merged and used as one single dataset.
The dataset is a simulated credit card transaction dataset containing legitimate and fraud transactions from the duration 1st Jan 2019 - 31st Dec 2020. It covers credit cards of 1000 customers doing transactions with a pool of 800 merchants.

I have used Stratified K_fold Cross Validation along with Adaptive Synthetic Sampling method (ADASYN) to reduce or counter balance the class imbalance in the dataset.
